Author: Kylan Chen

Professor: Professor John Alexis Guerra GÃ³mez

Assignment 3 homework queries for NEU Oakland CS3200 Spring 2024

Instructions: In this assignment you will practice the SQL skills developed in the course. For this, we will be using the sample SQLITE database found on https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/ . Download the database, and then, complete the following tasks:

  Query 1: Create a new Table Music Video, that is a class of type Track (generalization) but adds the attribute Video director. A music video is a track. There cannot be a video without a track, and each track can have either no video or just one. 
  Query 2: Write the queries that insert at least 10 videos, respecting the problem rules. Insert another video for the track
  Query 3: "Voodoo", assuming that you don't know the TrackId, so your insert query should specify the TrackId directly.

  Tip: For a different database with People and Quotes, here is how to insert a Quote from the name of the Person

  -- Inserts John in the Person table

  INSERT INTO Persons(name) VALUES("John");

  -- Inserts a new Quote for John

  INSERT INTO Quote(person_id, quote)
      SELECT person_id, "It Worked ðŸŽ‰"
      FROM Person
      WHERE name == "John";

  Query 4:  Write a query that lists all the customers that listen to longer-than-average tracks, excluding the tracks that are longer than 15 minutes. 
  Query 5:  Write a query that lists all the tracks that are not in one of the top 5 genres with longer duration in the database. 
  Query 6:  Define an insightful query on your own that involves at least three tables

## Format
There is one file for each query IE: query_1.sql

## How to run it 
These queries were made based on a sample SQlite database.

First, install SQLite and the sample database from https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/

Then, run the queries in sequential order IE: first run query_1.sql, then query_2.sql, etc.
